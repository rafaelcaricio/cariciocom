Following what has been happening on Twitter, I decided to leave. I had an account on Twitter for the last 14 years. It was fun, until it wasn't anymore. The toxicity and fear of "going viral" prevented me from posting a lot of possible interesting things over the last few years. Yes, before Elon Musk bought the company and sped up the ruin of the site.

I just wanted to share this fact here so that people who used to follow me on Twitter can find a reason why my account is not showing up. I used to have more than 1,000 followers on Twitter, but I doubt many of them will even notice my absence.

People need to have very good self-esteem to handle the toxicity of a tweet that gets more than 50 retweets. Everything I have ever posted that got half of that already had trolls and people questioning my existence. I don't need that toxicity in my life, thanks.
